# Parkinsons Diseases Genetics
Polygenic Risk Score and DNA Methylation Analysis for Parkinsons Diseases in the MPBC Cohort

These analysis start with collection and analysis of genotype data from 1864 participants in the MPBC PD study cohort, including cases and control

Some code for analysis were inspired by the PRS Pipeline in the [Global Parkinson's Disease Genetics programme](https://github.com/GP2-TNC-WG/GP2-Beginner-Bioinformatics-for-PD-Genetics/blob/master/README.md).

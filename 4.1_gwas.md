# Genome Wide Association Studies Using the Post-Imputation MPBC Genotype Data

NB: Running this pipeline is not necessarily needed as part of the analysis, but mostly for knowledge sake.

First, a covariate file is created using the Questionnaire, QC'ed, and Imputed data. This has been done in the ```3_creating_covariates.md``` document. 

However, in this document, the PHENO column is coded as 0 and 1 for controls and cases, respectively. This must be updated to 1 and 2, because the GWAS analysis in plink will produce an error if the phenotype isn't coded correctly. 

```bash
cd ../../
# make a new directory for the gwas analysis
mkdir 05_GWAS && cd 05_GWAS
# copy the covaiate file into the new directory
cp ../02_covariate_file/covariates.txt .

# use the python script to update the PHENO column this way:

python update_pheno.py ../../MPBC_HRC_Rsq03_updated.fam covariates.txt NEW_COVS.txt
```

Next, run the command below for perform GWAS computation in plink
NB: Check the screeplots generated in the ```Compute PCA``` section in the ```3_creating_covariates.md``` document to decide the appropriate number of principal components to include. The first 6 has been used here. 

```bash
plink --bfile ../../MPBC_HRC_Rsq03_updated --logistic --ci 0.95 --hide-covar --covar new_covariates.txt --covar-name AGE,SEX,EDUCATION,PC1,PC2,PC3,PC4,PC5,PC6 --out GWAS_RESULTS_MPBC

# The --hide-covar option removes each individual test from the output
```

NB: Other analysis like the QQPlots and Manhattan plots can be done to learn more :).
